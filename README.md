Kickstarter Analysis Week 1
Kickstarting with Excel
Kickstarter

Overview of Propose
To give a brief overview of the Kickstarter analysis, the analysis was comprised of discovering outcomes with paint a picture of how the plays did. We analyzed outcomes based on launch dates and also their outcomes, with that data we were able to paint a big picture of what was successful or not

Purpose
The purpose of the Kickstarter Analysis was to discover the number of successful, failed, and canceled plays, primarily

Analysis and Challenges
Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Looking at the graph, the number of successful plays increased for the months of May and June.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the graph, the information I was able to understand was that when the goal of revenue was lower, the number of successful plays increased versus others with a larger goal.

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I believe some of the challenges I encountered was with the formula for the “countifs” section, for some reason It was not working properly, I spent over 6 hours trying to figure out what the issue was. Finally, after several modifications to the formula and with some assistance, I was able to figure that section out. Also, there was so many filters that it was difficult to remember to filter them out for the data that was needed

Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One of two conclusions I can formulate regarding the Outcome based on Launch Date is that during the months of May and June, the number of successful plays far exceeded the failed sections. Second, in other months, failed and successful remain close in failed and successful rate.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I believe that most interesting fact about this chart is that most of the projects that had a higher goal did not reach that goal, in addition to that, the projects with a lower goal had a much higher successful percentage. The higher the goal the lower the percentage of successfulness.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
One of the limitations of the Kickstarter I observed was that it doesn’t account for some factors, like for example what happened in May and June that increased the number of successful on outcome based on launch date.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
If I had to create another graph, I would create one that showed the goal versus the pledged to illustrate how much or how short these plays fell from their goal.
